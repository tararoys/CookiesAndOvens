Jasmine-2.0.0-skeleton
======================

#Why this project?

Motivation for sticking the basic jasmine skeleton on my github: 

1. Downloading zips on my mac takes 10 clicks, involves pop-unders, and is therefore a huge pain. 
2. As a developer, because I know git, it is much easier for me to clone a repo instead of downloading a zip, 
3. so I am making this availible as  a github repo instead of a zip file.


#What if I don't like Git? Where can I get this Zipfile of which you speak? 

Fiar enough, I don't like git either.  It's hugely complicated, and I don't believe you should have to memorize 60 different magic Git commands to get the stuff you want. 

If you want to know how to get Jasmine the normal way, go to [The part of the documentation that tells you where to download the 'standalone distribution'](
http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html#standalone-distribution)

This will take you to the [distributions page on the Jasmine project](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/tree/master/dist)

You click on it, and here's what caused me a bit of a what-the-heck moment.  Instead of downloading the jasmine standalone, it takes you to [this page](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/blob/master/dist/jasmine-standalone-2.0.0.zip
), which doesn't have anything resembling a "Download this here" button.

What you have somehow magically figure out is that in order to downwnload the skeleton, you have to press the 'View Raw' link.  

Not very user friendly at all, especially since this 'downloading the zip' way is meant for people who don't know how to use the arcane magic of github.
